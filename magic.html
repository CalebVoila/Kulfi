        <pre>One year, the wicked Winter Witch decides that earth can have only one season and stops spring from coming.
  The earth gets covered in heavy snow and the sun is covered behind black clouds. People from a tiny village 
  in the mountains of Bulgaria wake up to see their houses covered with snow up to the roof. They dig tunnels 
  to reach their neighbors and discuss any possible solutions for this problem. They decide to ask for help 
  from Father Frost, who lived on the icy peak of the mountains.
  An old man among the villagers says he can go but is afraid if he can make it in time. His granddaughter asks him 
  not to worry and offers to go herself. The villagers discourage her as they are worried the little girl is too
  delicate to climb up the challenging icy mountain peaks.
  Children from the village lend their warm clothes to the young girl and she embarks on the tough journey. Blizzards, 
  whirlwinds, and Winter Witch throw several challenges at the little girl and threaten to kill her. But little mice,
  squirrels, and rabbits come to her rescue and help the little girl reach Father Frost.
  In his palace, Father Frost is sleeping peacefully and the little girl wakes him up to explain the situation. Father 
  Frost blows his whistle and a crystal ball appears; in the ball, he sees everything that had happened around him.
  He punishes the Wicked Witch, makes her lift the enchantment, and brings everything back to normal. Villagers are 
  happy and proud of the young girl as the sun starts shining again.</pre>

        <pre>In a faraway village lived a peasant and his wife. When a beggarwoman comes seeking food, the peasant’s wife offers
  her food. The beggarwoman gives her a barleycorn in return. The wife plants the barleycorn and surprisingly a tiny girl
  named Thumbelina emerges from the sprouted flower.
  One night, when Thumbelina is fast asleep in her cradle, she is carried off by a cruel toad to marry her off to her son.
  A friendly fish and butterfly help Thumbelina to escape the toad and her son. But her struggles don’t end. A beetle 
  stag captures her but throws her away when his friends don’t like Thumbelina’s company.
  An old mouse gives her shelter but insists her to marry the neighbor, a mole. Thumbelina does not like the mole because he 
  stays insides and never comes out to enjoy the light and air. She runs away from the mouse’s home and escapes to a 
  faraway land.
  In a sunny flower field, she meets a tiny flower fairy prince who is her size and starts liking him. They marry each other
  and after the wedding, she gets a pair of wings. She starts flying with her husband from one flower to another.</pre>

        <pre>Cinderella is a beautiful and kind-hearted girl whose world turns upside down on the death of her beloved mother. Her 
  father marries a wicked lady. The stepmother and the stepsisters are cruel to Cinderella, and treat her like a maid in 
  the house.
  One day, the king throws a royal ball and invites all the maidens in the kingdom as the prince would choose his bride. While
  the step sisters go to the ball dressed in fancy gowns, the stepmother tells Cinderella to stay at home and do the chores.
  The beautiful Cinderella is depressed about not going when her fairy godmother appears, blows fairy dust on a pumpkin and mice
  to convert them into a carriage and horses, and helps Cinderella dress up in the prettiest gown and crystal shoes. But the 
  fairy tells her that she has to return by 12 after which the magic will be all gone.
  The prince and Cinderella dance together all night but when the clock strikes 12, she leaves the party as per the instructions
  of the fairy godmother. Her glass shoe slips off her foot and is picked up by the prince.
  Next day, the prince goes in search of the girl whose feet would fit perfectly in the crystal shoes. It does not fit any girl’s 
  feet except Cinderella. The prince marries Cinderella and they live happily ever after.</pre>

        <pre>In a faraway village, lived a merchant with his daughters. While going on a journey, the merchant asks his daughters what 
  they want when he returns. Elder daughters ask for jewelry and precious stones but the youngest daughter, Belle, asks for his 
  safe return. When her father insists, Belle asks for a rose.
  When the father is returning, he stops by a garden to cut a rose flower but an ugly beast spots the merchant and punishes 
  him. When Belle gets to know about the beast, she goes to rescue her father. The beast says that he will free her father only 
  if she comes to stay with him in the palace.
  Belle agrees and joins the beast at his palace. All her needs in the palace are satisfied at just the clap of her hands. 
  Eventually the beast and Belle bond over friendship. One day, Belle finds the beast stumbling in pain outside the palace.
  Belle is scared. She fears the death of the beast and expresses her love for him. Then the magical spell reverses, and the 
  beast is transformed into a charming young prince. The prince marries Belle and they lived happily ever after.</pre>

        <pre>Two brothers are sent to kill a wild boar infesting a kingdom. The younger brother gets a magic spear and kills the boar 
  with no difficulty. The jealous older brother kills his sibling and buries him under a bridge, to claim the reward from the 
  king – the hand of the princess.
  Years later, a shepherd passes by the bridge, notices the bone and thinks it to be a mouthpiece. As he blows it, the bone sings
  thus:
              
  “Ah, friend, thou blowest upon my bone!
  Long have I lain beside the water;
  My brother slew me for the boar,
  And took for his wife the King’s young daughter.”
              
  Shocked, the shepherd takes the bone to the king, who understands the meaning of the son. The wicked older brother is punished for his crime.</pre>
